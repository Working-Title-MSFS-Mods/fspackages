# Working Title G3000

### Latest version: v0.4.1

### Description
This is a mod for MSFS2020 that aims to improve the in-game G3000 and G5000. The goal is to bring functionality closer to the real-life units, with a focus on both features and layout/UI.

This mod was created with cross-compatibility in mind. It modifies the minimum number of base files possible to achieve its goals, so it should be compatible with most other mods, including all other WorkingTitle mods. However, because of the nature of the mod, it will conflict with other mods that make changes to the G3000.

### Installation
Download `workingtitle-g3000-v0.4.1.zip` from the Github release page. Do not download the Source code files unless you are sure you want those.

To install, copy the `workingtitle-g3000` folder from the zip file into your `Community` directory.

If you want to enable the road display for the navigation map, you must also download `workingtitle-g3000-roaddata-v0.1.0.zip` from the Github release page. To install the road data package, copy the `workingtitle-g3000-roaddata` folder from the zip file into your `Community` directory. Requires 1.3 GB of hard drive space.

### Configuration File
Certain mod settings can be customized via a configuration file which is located at `workingtitle-g3000\html_ui\WTg3000.cfg`. Documentation for the various settings can be found in the file itself. If you make changes to the file while the game is running, you must restart the game for the changes to take effect.

#### Release Highlights for v0.4.1

- Added mod configuration file.
- Added road display for the navigation map (requires the optional `workingtitle-g3000-roaddata` package).

**Fixes**
- \[General\] Fixed performance degradation over time.

### Known Issues
- \[Stability\] The game will CTD when clearing origin and destination from the flight plan and attempting to enter a new origin/destination.
- \[Compatibility\] Using this mod with the WorkingTitle GX mod may result in various flight planning bugs, such as blank waypoint entries in the GTC active flight plan page and avionics freeze when initiating a Direct To to an approach waypoint.
- \[PFD\] (Vanilla issue) Co-pilot PFD softkeys are nonfunctional in the TBM 930.
- \[NavMap\] Airspaces are currently not available to display. The way the game loads data for these features is unreliable at best, and more time is needed to come up with a satisfactory solution to rendering them. Expect them to be added back at a later date.
- \[NavMap\] The flight plan renderer currently does not draw turn anticipation arcs or turn to intercept legs. These will be added later.
- \[NavMap\] All airport waypoints are shown as if they are serviced, regardless of whether they actually are. This is because waypoint data from the game is currently missing this information.
- \[NavMap\] Airport waypoint symbols will only show around a certain geographic distance from the center of the map (this does not apply to airports that are part of the active flight plan). This is due to the way the game searches for airports (the number of results is limited for performance reasons and there is no option to filter the search e.g. by size to reduce the performance penalty).
- \[Weather Radar\] When NEXRAD is enabled for the navigation map in the right MFD pane, the weather radar display in the left MFD pane will have artifacts. This does not occur with the opposite arrangement (i.e. NEXRAD enabled in left MFD pane, weather radar in right MFD pane). The bug also occurs when enabling NEXRAD for the PFD inset map. A workaround for now is to simply disable NEXRAD or to enable it in the left pane instead of the right (and disable it for the PFD inset map) if you wish to use it in conjunction with the weather radar.

### FAQ
- **Q**: I copied the mod folder to my Community folder but don't get any of the new features. What do I do?
  - **A**: Make sure you downloaded the *correct* mod folder. It should be named `workingtitle-g3000` and be contained in a .zip file named `workingtitle-g3000-v[version number]`.
- **Q**: Why do I no longer have synthetic vision on the PFD after installing the mod?
  - **A**: The mod introduces the option to toggle synthetic vision on/off and the setting defaults to off. To turn it back on, use the touchscreen controllers and navigate to PFD Home -> PFD Settings -> SVT Terrain Enable. Alternatively, *for the TBM 930 only*, use the PFD softkeys to navigate to PFD Settings -> Altitude Overlays -> Synthetic Terrain.
- **Q**: When I copy the mod folder to my Community folder, why do I get an error saying the file path name is too long?
  - **A**: This is a Windows issue. By default, Windows limits file paths to 260 characters. You can disable this limit by modifying the system registry (not as scary as it sounds). Tutorials for how to do so can easily be found with a Google (or Bing) search.
- **Q**: Why do I sometimes get low performance/FPS with the mod?
  - **A**: The single largest performance sink (when it comes to avionics) is the navigational map. The mod actually uses a completely new code base for the navmap that is _more_ performant than the default. However, the mod also allows many more features to be drawn on the map than is possible with the unmodded map (as well as allowing for two independent navmaps to be displayed on the MFD), which is where performance can start to suffer. Generally, the more _waypoints_ and _text labels_ drawn on the map, the greater the impact on performance.
- **Q**: Does the mod support VNAV or inputting airways into the flight plan?
  - **A**: Not yet. Support will be coming with a future update.
