# Working Title CJ4 Mod

## UPDATES
Latest Version: [v0.4.0](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages/releases/tag/cj4-v0.4.0)

Changelog: [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages/blob/main/docs/workingtitle-cj4/CHANGES.md)

## BETA
This is a beta, and as such you will surely encounter bugs and problems with the aircraft and functions. Please log these bugs under Issues at the [Working Title Github Repo](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages/issues), and please **TAG THEM** as CJ4 issues. 

## OTHER MODS
Because of how the Community folder works, this mod will conflict with any other mod that includes one or more of the same files in the package. We have not included aircraft.cfg or any exterior textures so that the livery mods should work along side this mod. We have incorporated mods, such as the lighting mod from Uwajimaya. You can see where we've included these in the release notes.

## INTRO
This mod aims to modify the default CJ4 to genuinely represent the true capabilities, functions and features of the real aircraft. This mod will continue to be developed over time to add further functionality.

### INSTALLING
Download the release zip file and extract the enclosed folder workingtitle-aircraft-cj4 into your Community folder to enable this mod.

### OPERATING NOTES
While incomplete, this section will be updated with recommended operating procedures and instructions for the added capabilities

### FMC
With the added functions of the PERF menu, the FMC will calculate takeoff and landing speeds on their respective pages. You need to enter the winds as DDD/SS (where DDD is the magnetic direction of the wind and SS is the speed). You need to enter the temp in degrees C, so for 15C you'd enter just 15; you can read the SAT temp from the bottom of the MFD and use that temp for departure. You need to enter the pressure in inHG with the decimal, so for example, 29.92 - at this time HPA is not supported.

You can use the "SEND" soft key on the FMS pages to transmit your automatically calculated VSpeeds to the PFD and they'll appear there in magenta. If you modify them directly on the PFD, they will be set to cyan to indicate they are not FMC values.
