# Documentation for the Working Title G1000

_Applies to version: v0.4.0_

The stock G1000 in SU5 has almost all the features of our original freeware mod, although the styling is still much as it as always been.   This is a very small modification to the stock G1000 that will add support for our extended engine pages configurations.   Everything else is as in the stock system.

Within a few days of the release of SU5, our G1000 NXi will be released on the Marketplace and this mod will be fully deprecated.
