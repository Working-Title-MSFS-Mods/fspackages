# Working Title MSFS Mods

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

As of [Aircraft and Avionics Update 1](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/aircraft-avionics-i-release-notes-1-30-12-0/572740), all active Working Title content has been fully integrated into the standard Microsoft Flight Simulator installation.  The packages in this repository are no longer needed, and should be uninstalled from your Community directory to avoid conflicts with the base game content.

This repository is being preserved for its history and to provide access to old releases, but should be considered obsolete.

Our current open source code, as shipped with the simulator, is available on github at the [official Microsoft repository](https://github.com/microsoft/msfs-avionics-mirror/).  You can find more information about our current projects on [our website](https://www.workingtitle.aero/packages/) and communicate with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/Fa6w2xK).
