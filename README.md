# Working Title MSFS Mods

# With the release of the MSFS 1.9.3.0 patch today, you can expect most if not all mods to require updates to work correctly. The Working Title team advises you to remove all mods, including our CJ4 and G1000 mods, from your Community folder until such time as they are updated. As has been the case with past updates from Asobo, there were significant changes to the codebase. In fact, this update is the most invasive from a file structure standpoint, with many files moving locations and quite a number of name changes. About 17,000 files were changed. We are currently in the process of assessing these differences and will shortly begin incorporating them into our code. We will try to get updates out as quickly as possible.

This is the home of mods for the new Microsoft Flight Simulator from the Working Title team.  We have a number of projects either in the works or planned.  Here is the status of what is currently being worked on and links to downloadable releases.
