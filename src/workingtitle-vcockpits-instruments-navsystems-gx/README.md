# Working Title GX Avionics

This is a *very* early version of a Working Title avionics package for the G3X and the G3X Touch.  Currently only the G3X Touch is supported.

This is shipped with an alternate and, IMHO, less ugly color scheme for the buttons.
If you prefer the stock look, you can simply remove or rename `html_ui\WorkingTitle\Pages\VCockpit\Instruments\NavSystems\AS3X_Touch\AS3X_Touch_Buttons.css`.

Changes:

* Button added for controlling wind data mode
* Annunciations positions and styled
* Automatic pitot heat simulated w/warning light.
