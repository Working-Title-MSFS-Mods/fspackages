# Features

## Synthetic Vision
            
* Added airport signs which show where airports are in 3d and can be toggled on/off
* Added horizon headings which show headings at 30 degree increments on the horizon and can be toggled on/off

## Map

* Relative colouring added for TAWS
* Track vector added with length support
* Fuel ring added with reserve time support
* Settings menu added with controls for range for airportsm, intersections, VORs, NDBs and cities
* Cities added

## Airways

* Airways can be selected for a waypoint on the flight plan
* Will show a UI where you can select the airway and an exit
* Updates to show the route in real time

## Procedure Pages

* See the procedure in realtime when choosing a procedure and transitions
* Alternate transitions are also visible in a dimmed colour

## Direct TO

* Now supports the course parameter
* Choose a course oher than the default to create a user waypoint 100nm from the location in the direction specified
* Very useful for VFR landings

## Others

* Units can be selected for a variety of data types which is reflected across the majority of the UI on both the PFD and MFD
* Debug menu and console added

# Enhancements

* Accuracy of the flight path marker has been greatly improved
* Hand made input component for ICAOs, numbers, drop down boxes, switches, buttons, strings, confirmation windows and times that are a lot more responsive and functional
* Soft key buttons highlight when clicked (mostly, needs some work still)
* Adjusting volume now briefly shows the volume value

## Engine Display

* 3 CSS variables (--engine-color-green, --engine-color-yellow, --engine-color-red) are provided now for engine panel authors to use semantic colouring instead of fixed colours

## Map

* Accurate zoom levels
* Track up displaces the view downwards

## Transponder

* Coloured correctly for mode
* Auto selects ALT mode upon take off #240
* Reply status indicator (faked for realism)
* VFR can be set to 1200 or 7000 from the MFD settings page #233

## Local Time

* Support for 12/24 hour local time and Zulu/UTC time

## HSI

* Course adjuster for setting VOR bearings now has new logic for incrementing the value, making it easier to be more precise when spinning rapidly

## OAT

* Celsius / Farenheit support via MFD settings

## Barometric Pressure

* Support for InMG and HPA

## MFD Data Bar 

* Data bar is fully customisable from the new settings page. Currently supports: BRG, DIS, DTK, ETA, ETE, FOB, FOD, GS, TAS, TRK and XTK

## Airport Information Page

* Weather page added - not implemented ideally, pulls from a remote source
* Selecting a runway will zoom to it on the map, making it clear which one it is you are looking at

## Settings Page

* Settings page added which has most of the functionality of the real G1000. The following settings are functional:
    * Time format
    * All unit selections - will not apply to everything currently
    * Data bar values
    * Channel spacing
* Settings are saved permanently for the specific model of plane

## Mod settings page

* Mod settings page added with non-prototypical options. The following settings are functional:
    * Range knob - Toggle between range and zoom which inverts the range knob direction
    * Navigation knob - Toggle between normal and reversed usage of the navigation knob
    * VFR default squawk

## Flight Plan

* Support for wide and narrow view modes, with the following extra fields on the wide view: ETE, ETA, Fuel and Bearing

## Nearest Waypoint Pages

* Now shows a line from your position to the highlighted waypoint
* Nearest airports page allows you to jump directly to approaches by clicking ENT

# Visuals

* Rebuilt styling to closely match the real thing.
* In many places a sans-serif font has been chosen as it can be a little easier to fit larger text in to make it easier to read. This is a little different to the real thing but was done for improving the sim experience

## PFD

* Increased accuracy of font sizes and positions
* Added outlines, etc around parts of the instruments

## Attitude Indicator

* Ratio between above and below the horizon more closesly matches reality
* Amount of visible graduations changes realistically depending on whether synthetic vision is enabled

## Altimer / Airspeed Indicator

* Cursors are a bit cleaner now with padding around the black background

## HSI

* Colours correctly updated for nav source on bearing - #236
* Outlines added to needles and various text to make them clearer
* Removed backgrounds from text
* Needles for CDI and bearings now realistically interpolate to their selected values
* Circles improved by creating paths instead of svg circles (Coherent doesn't seem to do a good job here and makes them very blurry)

# Performance

* Whole UI has been rebuilt with a performance first mentality
* Potentially runs at full speed in under 1ms for both panels other than occassional spikes
* Can expect 5-10fps improvement in a cpu bound scenario
* Waypoints load far faster which results in more a responsive map and other UI elements as they don't load procedures and airways until needed

# Bug Fixes

* Difficult to list bug fixes here as the whole UI has been effectively redone which should have fixed many general minor bugs with the previous UI

# Known Issues

* No ability to use HSI arc mode currently
* Direct To will show "unknown" for origin and destination as it's integrated as a separate system
* Some procedures will not show correctly if they have unusual leg types that are not implemented
* Procedures visually will not match the procedure when loaded as the current ingame flight planner does a poor job with many procedures
* There is a serious memory leak issues which I don't believe is triggered unless you reload the UI but as we am not sure of the cause, we cannot say for sure it won't affect others (It also appears to be an internal rendering engine bug)
* Highlights for checklists will not work
